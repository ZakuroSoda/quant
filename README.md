## Replay Trading Platform by ZakuroSoda

This platform takes advantage of Python's plotly (and dash) library to create a replay trading platform. It allows you to replay historical data and trade on it, with the ability to use any strategy you want (purely discretionary).

The platform is designed to be easy to use and understand, with a simple interface that allows you to focus on your trading strategy. There is no built in trading journal, so another Excel sheet can be used.

> **Plotly and Dash was NOT meant to be used like this. There is quite a lot of black magic needed to pull off the replay effect.**

> In the code, you will see some commented areas where I have no clue how it works, but it works.
